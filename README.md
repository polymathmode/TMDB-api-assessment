# TMDB-api-assessment
An app that basically displays the movie data from the TMDB open source api
The app displays in grid format real-time data of movies from the TMDB api.
I used typescript and plain vanilla css for styling of the ui.
To start the app,run "yarn" to install all dependencies before running "yarn start"
